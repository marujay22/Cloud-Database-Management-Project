# Cloud-Database-Management-Project

**Project for Syracuse University's School of Information Studies course IST 659**

**Background**

Cloud migration is a way to manage data across cloud platforms, either with or instead of on-premises storage. The cloud is useful as a data storage tier for disaster recovery, backup and long-term archiving.Cloud offers several benefits:

● The cloud offers better insights from big data

● The cloud is flexible & scalable

● The cloud drives collaboration efficiency

● The cloud ensures business continuity and disaster recovery

● Cloud is simple & cost-effective

**Why we selected this project ?** 

Through this project we aim to answer the following questions:

● What major companies have migrated to Cloud service from a traditional database?

● Which industry sectors have adopted Cloud services the most?

● After migrating to the cloud, which industry sector has seen the highest rate of growth?\

● What type of cloud(multi, hybrid, single) is preferred by companies?

● What part of their budget are the companies allocating for cloud services?

● Which Cloud vendor is preferred by companies?

The main purpose of our project is to design a database that provides us with the statistics regarding the companies that have migrated from traditional database systems to Cloud services. It will also allow us to know which sector is moving fast towards cloud migration and which sector has benefitted the most from it. Apart from that, we wish to display the rising trend of cloud migration, whose rate is at an accelerated pace, thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic.
